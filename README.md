Text Justification Problem

Given an array of strings words and a width maxWidth, formats the text such that each line has exactly maxWidth characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

Packs words in a greedy approach; packing as many words per line. Pads extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.

Extra spaces between words distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it is left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.
